### Business Problem
Microsoft is planning to venture into film production by opening a new studio and need actionable insights into movie data to determine which films to produce in order to do succeed at the box office.  

We will clean, assemble, interpret, and visualize data from the given data sets in order to provide recommendations for business decisions.  

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)  

### Business Understanding  
In order to provide specific recommendations, we selected several metrics to use:  
-Producers  
-Genres  
-Release Dates  

### Topic Details and Motivation:
- Which producers create consistently the best-rated films?
	- Along with their film ratings, which producers have the largest margins between production budget and box office income?
- Which genres of films do the best in theaters?
	- Creating movies in popular genres will attract more initial viewers.
	- Comparing film genres with their overhead costs and ROIs can provide insights on which types of films could be profitable.
- What time of year do film releases do best?
	- Viewership will impact the film's overall income and releasing films during peak seasons or months can increase viewership.
	- Exploring the frequency of film releases throughout the year can also provide insights on when other studios are releasing movies and how to address competing films.


## Methods:   
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  

### Data Understanding (include one example graph for each topic here):  
Producers:  

Genres:  

Release Dates:  

###Evaluation:
Through this data analysis, we are able to provide several recommendations based on our measures of success:  
-While there is a general upward trend with return on production budget, it is possible to select a producer with higher profit margins based on their previous films.
-Animation, fantasy, and adventure genres for films historically have a higher potential to net positive.
-Summer film releases are the most succesful for a high net income. 

###Conclusion:
This data can be useful to finetune selections based on individual budget, staffing, and style limitations. 

Our recommendations look to minimize budget and maximize net income but depending on individual goals, the information allows to explore other intersections.
